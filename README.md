## ✅ What is StyleSheet in React Native?

ans: StyleSheet is React Native’s built-in way of writing styles, similar to CSS, but not actual CSS.

- “StyleSheet is React Native’s built-in CSS-like styling system, written as JavaScript objects and optimized for native performance.”


👉 It comes pre-installed with React Native.
👉 You don’t install anything extra.

import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native';


How its like css:

| CSS (Web)          | StyleSheet (React Native) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `background-color` | `backgroundColor`         |
| `font-size`        | `fontSize`                |
| `margin-top`       | `marginTop`               |
| `display: flex`    | `flex` (default)          |





   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
